Employee Analysis Project
Overview
This project analyzes employee data for ABC Company, using a dataset containing 458 rows and 9 columns. The primary goal is to process, analyze, and visualize key insights about employees working across various teams. The tasks include data cleaning, distribution analysis, salary expenditure analysis, and examining correlations between age and salary.

The project involves a comprehensive report of findings, supported by visualizations to effectively communicate the data story.

Objectives
The objectives of this project are:

Preprocessing: Clean and correct the dataset, ensuring data integrity.
Analysis: Perform key analyses to extract useful insights, including:
Distribution of employees across teams
Segregation of employees by positions
Identification of the predominant age group
Salary expenditure analysis by team and position
Correlation between age and salary
Visualization: Create clear, informative graphs for each analysis task to help present findings.
Insights: Provide meaningful insights and trends based on the analysis.
Tasks Completed
Data Preprocessing:

Cleaned the height column by replacing the data with random values between 150 and 180, ensuring the dataset's consistency.
Employee Distribution by Team:

Analyzed the number of employees across each team and calculated their percentage relative to the total number of employees.
Created a bar plot to visualize the distribution.
Segregation by Position:

Segregated employees based on their positions within the company.
Visualized the distribution using a bar plot.
Predominant Age Group:

Identified the most common age group among employees.
Visualized the age distribution using a histogram.
Salary Expenditure by Team and Position:

Analyzed which team and position have the highest salary expenditures.
Visualized the results using bar plots.
Correlation Between Age and Salary:

Investigated the relationship between employee age and salary.
Created a scatter plot to represent the correlation visually.
Insights
Team Distribution: The dataset revealed which teams have the highest and lowest employee counts, providing insight into team size and resource allocation.
Predominant Age Group: The analysis identified the most common age group, helping to understand the workforce's age demographics.
Salary Expenditure: The team and position with the highest salary expenditure were identified, offering insight into the company's compensation strategy.
Age and Salary Correlation: The relationship between age and salary was visualized, helping to assess whether older employees tend to have higher salaries due to experience or other factors.
Graphical Representations
Each of the tasks above is complemented by relevant visualizations:

Bar plots for team distribution and position distribution.
Histogram for age distribution.
Bar plots for salary expenditures.
Scatter plot for the correlation between age and salary.
These visualizations help communicate the findings clearly and are an integral part of the analysis.

Technologies Used
Python for data analysis and visualization.
Pandas for data manipulation and cleaning.
Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
Numpy for generating random numbers (used in preprocessing).
